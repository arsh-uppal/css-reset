# CSS Reset for New Projects

This CSS reset is designed to provide a clean and consistent foundation for new projects. It ensures better typography, form styling, and media handling while improving accessibility and usability.

## Features

- **Better Box Model:** Uses `border-box` for more intuitive sizing.
- **Improved Text Rendering:** Ensures smooth fonts and proper line height.
- **Enhanced Media Defaults:** Images and videos are responsive by default.
- **Form Element Inheritance:** Resets form elements to inherit fonts and removes unwanted styles.
- **Prevent Text Overflow:** Ensures text breaks correctly and wraps properly.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Enables `scroll-behavior: smooth` when motion preference allows.
- **Root Stacking Context:** Adds `isolation: isolate` to prevent unexpected stacking issues.

## Usage

Simply include the `reset.css` file at the start of your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="reset.css">
```

Alternatively, you can copy the styles directly into your project's global CSS file.
